# ctf-vault

This repository contains **writeups** for various CTF challenges and machines from different platforms and other things that go around them.

My intention is to do **detailed work** that will be useful to me and hopefully to others as well, to better understand some of the various aspects of cybersecurity and improve in organizing information.

Folders and files currently present:

- **docs**: contains writeup templates I created to help me write them more coherently and in a standardized way

- **picoctf**: contains writeups for challenges from [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)

- **tools**: it will contain useful tools for solving CTF challenges and machines

- this **README.md**

---

This repository is updated and expanded in my **spare time**.

You can find some of the writeups I made in a bit more visually appealing way on my [**blog**](https://brynrefill.com).

I would appreciate it if you could send me any **feedback** you might have for me. I'm all ears :&rpar;
